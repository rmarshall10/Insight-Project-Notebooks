# JuggleMaster

Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, and there are millions of young, developing players around the world. However, it is difficult to get kids to practice on their own, especially in places like the US, where there is much less of a “pick-up” soccer culture than other places.

Soccer juggling is a great way to improve hand-foot coordination and foot skills which you can do on your own, or with others. Soccer juggling is where you keep the ball in the air by hitting it with your feet, or other body parts except for the hands.

This app counts the consecutive juggles of a player, and determines which body part they use for each juggle. It could assign different point values to different body parts, or have “levels” where players have to juggle in certain sequences.
